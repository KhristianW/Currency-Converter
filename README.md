# Currency-Converter
A simple Currency Converter using JFrame

This code only has 6 currencies to choose from (U.S. Dollar, Euro, Japanese Yen, Korean Won, British Pound, and Philippine peso)
If you want to add your own currencies, just read the code and implement your currency like how I have the other currencies formatted
Also note that you may need to update the currency exchange rate as the code may be outdatted.

There's nothing you need to type or do when you get the code in the program, just run it.

When the code is ran:
- Select the currency you want to convert from and the currency you want to convert to out of the 6 currencies that's there.
- Type in the amount you want to convert in the text field and click compute and do your thing.
- When you type in the currency you want to convert, don't press enter on your keyboard as it just hits the exit button.
- Also, the exit button won't work unless you convert a currency first.
